StupidHttp
==========

As the name indicates, **StupidHttp** is a very simple (and not very smart) HTTP
library for PHP. It only supports one client, and implements only the minimum
features of the HTTP spec (and probably even less). However, it's a very
helpful library to have if you want to quickly preview a static website locally,
or if you want your application to feature a development web server.

website](http://bolt80/stupidhttp/).
